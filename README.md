# Strava Deep Dive
Looking into 3 months worth of Strava data. Unfortunately, I do not have a HR monitor, so this not included in the analysis. There is another metric 'Perceived Relative Effort' that sums exertion. Because I don't have HR data, I will used 'Perceived Relative Effort' to measure the intensity of my workouts. Here is their definition per the Strava website: 

"Relative Effort, found on the activity details page, measures how much cardiovascular work went into any activity that has heart rate data or Perceived Exertion. A short and hard activity can require just as much effort as a long and leisurely one, and Relative Effort makes it so you can compare the two. Not only that, but different activity types are weighted so that your efforts can be compared across sports, and your values are personalized to your own heart rate zones so you can even compare with other athletes.

If you and a friend both ran your hardest 10K effort, your Relative Efforts would be similar even if your finishing times are different. Similarly, if you rode a bike as hard as you could for the same amount of time, your Relative Effort would be comparable."

In this analysis I aim to answer questions like:
- How many times of each activity have I recorded?
- Are my runs trending faster?
- Will I meet my yearly running goal?
